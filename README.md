# Introduction

## What is this book about?

I wrote my first line of code in 2013. And after 5 years of studying in college and 3 years of working as software engineer, I am now helping people around me to kickstart their career as programmer.  

One of the biggest challenge I found is finding good learning resources for starters. Since now we live in an era information explosion, every time when I try to learn something new, I can easily get overwhelmed by the amount of tutorials out there on the Internet and will go through a hard time filtering out which materials to learn from. That being said, there are thousands of good materials worth mentioning. And many existing guides to index those materials like this [Self-Learning Modern Computer Science Curriculum](https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/).  

Yet I am still trying to write another guide for the exact same propose. Why? The main reasons is I can't find a good index of resource for _subway learners._ What is the gap? I think there are two major issues:

* Most of existing guide recommend lengthy materials, like a full textbook or 32 hours course. They are nice learning resource. While in reality I found many people don't really have time to keep up with a full syllabus. Most of time because they are trying to learn something during their fragmentation time, like learning after full time job. In this case some lightweight "fast food" resource might be the one to rescue.
* Most knowledge have dependency to each other, using a correct material at correct time can be tricky, otherwise you can easily fall into a “knowledge hell“ --- trying to understand a jargon based on another jargon.

Therefore in this blog I captures all the materials I call _sparkling materials_ --- The one I found useful while still being lightweight. So that you can pick up a section using your pocket of time and still enjoy the joy of:

> Complex ideas explained in a simple way

Also, I try to order everything based on an implicit learning path from _n00b_ to _expert_. You can just follow the chapters so you can

> Save you time to figure out what to learn next.
