# Rules to keep in mind

### What is a scroll?

When my parents first decide to abandon their original major \(medicine\) completely and start their own business, they were backed up by a book [The Greatest Salesman in the World](https://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Salesman-World-Og-Mandino-ebook/dp/B004G8PIQ8), they read scrolls in it everyday in the morning to absorb energy and ideas to guide their new day.

Now I want to create a similar scrolls for new computer science learners --- Some tricks worth reminding yourself everyday to help you learn quicker

### \#1 Don’t panic, you will understand

The most rewarding and frustrating things for learning programming is by the end of the day, you will always have something you can’t not figure out. When I first taking my operating system during college, I literally cried and bite myself just for an answer about memory and threading. Now, even though I still have the habit of biting my right hand, I have much less anxiety before going to bed after a day. Because I realized `no matter how hard the problem sounds to you today, you will always able to understand it sometime in the future, might be tomorrow, or one year later, but you will understand.` That’s also why most programmers never stop learning — they are always in a cycle of thinking, understanding and using.

### \#2 Discussion before decision

Software is not physics, most of time there is no one true rule. Most concept you learn are just `guidelines`, they are taught by your professors because it is suitable for most cases, or simply it is built in this way and a lot of people are already using it this way. One example is programming languages. There are hundreds of programming language out there in the world, you can choose any of them to build an amazing website. Then why we can’t have one single language? Because different people create those language with different intentions, so each of them have slightly different characteristic. Some language have better security concern, some may good at performance. `When it comes to decision, don’t say “my text book said I should use this”. Think of your needs and analyze tradeoffs.` And remember, all roads lead to Rome, you should not limit yourself just for following some unnecessary guidelines.

### \#3 Ask why

Because software are built by humans and there are multiple ways of doing same thing. It’s important to understand why about everything. If you know why a library is built in this way, it will help you next time when using a similar tool. If you learn why a system is architect in this way, it will help you make tradeoffs when you do your own design. Further more, as you learn more “whys”, you will start to `argue about existing tools and system` because they are all built by humans, and human make mistakes.

### \#4 Keep writing code

It will be extremely hard for you to understand all the ideas at once. The best way to learn is try it out, all those commonly used pattern are built by smart people who has done the same routine thousands times and realized there are something they can abstract to make life easier. Therefore the best way to understand it is repeat the same routine and be in the same place as the people who create those patterns. Sometimes reading some definition from book won't give you an answer and you will still be confused even after reading it 100 times.

### \#5 Read other's code

There is a common misunderstanding of reading and copying code: Lots of people from a different professional tend to think it is unethical to peek into other work and try to imitate. This is not true when it comes to coding. Of course, I am not asking you to plagiarize. But you can still read and understand lots of other code before implementing your own things, and it is ok to end up with similar solution. In fact `the ability of understand other's code is one of the most important skills in software engineering.` There are two main reason: First, reusing other's work is the quickest way for you to learn or get something done. Second, the way software involve is through sharing, you always need to understand the codebase before making any contribution. When a people shares source code to you, you become the owner of those code and will carry the same responsibility to make it better. And you will gradually find out whatever is out there almost never been a perfect solution. So don't think of you are stealing some top trading secret. The source code people shared is more like a forum for discussion, and getting into those discussion is mutually beneficial.

### \#6 The zone of productivity

In software engineering, one hour of deep focused work is more important than whole day of poking things around with a distracted mind. So try to give yourself some time by switching of email system, mobiles and other mundane non-productive applications. Focus on the project you try to build, the question you try to answer. And find a routine that easily get you into "the zone". That is the key to productivity

### \#7 Learn just enough to do

Never try to understanding everything at once, this is critically important if you are learning something new. Trying to understand too many concepts at once tend to make me confused. My rule of thumb is learn just enough to ask an expert, and only dive deep if you need to. A good way to keep you on-track is project based learning, instead of going through table of contents of a book, try to aim at building a mini game or website. You will learn all the practical knowledge after getting things done. Eventually you will find all the pieces for the whole puzzle.

### \#8 Driven by curiosity

Learning is a exhausted process. It is easy to to feel there is a huge gap between what you have learned and what you want to accomplish. So taking break is important to keep you energetic. Instead of setting one hard goal and keep pushing yourself in that direction, always reserve sometime for yourself to search around in other areas. Let your curiosity lead the way and get new inspiration from the small but interesting findings. Enjoy some low hanging fruit is the small trick to conquer something with steep learning curve.

### \#9 Anticipate your brain

Be familiar with your own learning process. Try to find out what you are good at and not. Some people prefer learning from video material while other enjoy more reading. Some people have better memory and some people is good at logic. There is no one way for all and you are the only master that can teach yourself how to learn things faster.

### \#10 Software is about abstraction

This is what I believe one of the most important and elegant thing about software. Once you abstract something, it become a black box, you won’t need to know how it work inside, you can just use it and assuming you will get the result you want. We abstract electric current into bits, bits into numbers and strings, common routines into functions, functions into application. Every time we figure out how to do something \(e.g. make coffee\), we abstract it so that it can be reuse at other places \(e.g. coffee machine\). `For every line of code we wrote, we are using and building some kind of abstraction.` Because of abstraction, we can stand on the shoulders of previous coders.
